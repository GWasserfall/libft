**Mandatory part**
* A structure name must begin with s_.
* A typedef name must begin with t_.
* A union name must begin with u_.

* The names of files and directories must be composed exclusively of lowercase, numbers and '_' (Unix Case).
* The file must be compilable.

**Suggested part**
* Objects (variables, functions, macros, types, files or directories) must have the most explicit or mnemonic names. Only 'counters' can be named as you wish.
* Abbreviations are tolerated to the extent that they significantly reduce the size of the name without losing meaning. Parts of composite names will be separated by '_'.
* All identifiers (functions, macros, types, variables, etc.) must be in English.
* Any use of global variable must be justified.
